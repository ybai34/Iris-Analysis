# Iris-Analysis
This is the extra credit exam of DSCC 465 Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning, 2024 Spring, University of Rochester

## Extra Credit: Clustering Performance

## Overview
This project is an extra credit assignment for applying various clustering algorithms on the Iris dataset from the scikit-learn package. The goal is to compare the homogeneity scores of different clustering results.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Iris dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library.

## Normalization
All variables in the dataset (excluding the class variable) have been normalized to a 0-1 range.

## Clustering Algorithms
The following clustering algorithms have been applied with `k=3`:
- K-Means
- Mini-batch K-Means
- Agglomerative Clustering
- Spectral Clustering

## Homogeneity Scores
The homogeneity scores for each clustering algorithm are calculated and compared to evaluate the clustering performance.
